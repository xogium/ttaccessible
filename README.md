# TTAccessible

A native, fully accessible TeamTalk client for macOS, built with VoiceOver as a first-class citizen.

The official TeamTalk Qt client on Mac has significant accessibility issues — broken navigation, unresponsive context menus, audio crackling, and sluggish VoiceOver announcements. TTAccessible is a from-scratch alternative that puts screen reader users first.

## Features

- **Full VoiceOver support** — every window, menu, control, and navigation flow is built for screen readers
- **Full keyboard navigation** — Cmd+1/2/3/4 for UI areas, F5/F6/F7 for identity and channels, and many more
- **Native macOS interface** — real AppKit + SwiftUI, not a cross-platform wrapper
- **Channel browsing and joining** — tree view with users, subchannels, topics
- **Channel and private chat** — with clickable links and VoiceOver announcements
- **File sharing** — upload/download with progress, speed, ETA
- **Advanced audio engine** — custom dual-path capture (AVAudioEngine + standalone AUHAL), input gain, channel selection, echo cancellation
- **WebRTC AEC3 echo cancellation** — with real speaker output capture via Core Audio taps (macOS 14.2+), cancels VoiceOver and system sounds
- **Adaptive jitter buffer** — improves audio quality on unstable connections
- **Recording** — muxed (all voices) or per-user, WAV or OGG format, auto-restart on channel change
- **Per-user volume and stereo balance** — persisted across sessions
- **Server administration** — user accounts, bans, server properties, save config
- **Per-event announcement customization** — choose exactly which events get announced
- **Three sound packs** — Default, Majorly-G, Old
- **Auto-reconnect** — with last channel rejoin
- **.tt file import/export** — and tt:// link support
- **Automatic updates** — signed and notarized releases delivered in-app via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org)
- **English and French localization**

## Requirements

- **macOS 14.0** or later
- **Apple Silicon** (M1, M2, M3, M4, or later)
- Echo cancellation with speaker tap requires **macOS 14.2+** (falls back to SDK-only reference on older systems)

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Xcode (with command line tools)
- [p7zip](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/p7zip) — `brew install p7zip`

### Setup

The TeamTalk SDK binary is not included in the repository. Download it before building:

```bash
./scripts/download-sdk.sh
```

This downloads `libTeamTalk5.dylib` and `TeamTalk.h` from the [official TeamTalk SDK](https://www.bearware.dk/?page_id=419) and places them in `Vendor/TeamTalk/`.

### Build

For development:

The Xcode project uses automatic code signing with an **Apple Development** certificate tied to the maintainer's team. If you do not have that certificate, disable code signing when building locally:

```bash
# Debug build
xcodebuild -project App/ttaccessible.xcodeproj -scheme ttaccessible -configuration Debug CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

# Release build
xcodebuild -project App/ttaccessible.xcodeproj -scheme ttaccessible -configuration Release CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

### Packaging (maintainers)

`./build.sh` is for the maintainer team only. It still runs `xcodebuild` with the project's automatic signing settings, so it requires the same **Apple Development** certificate as building in Xcode — it does not produce an unsigned app for other contributors.

```bash
./build.sh              # Release .app and zip in BuildArtifacts/
./build.sh --notarize   # Developer ID signature + Apple notarization
./build.sh --release    # Notarize and publish to GitHub (updates Sparkle appcast)
```

Public releases are signed with a **Developer ID Application** certificate and notarized by Apple. The `--notarize` and `--release` flags apply that maintainer-only signing workflow on top of the Xcode build.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `ttaccessible-*.zip` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/math65/ttaccessible/releases).
2. Unzip and drag `ttaccessible.app` into `/Applications`.
3. Double-click to launch.

The app is signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so no Gatekeeper prompt appears on first launch. Subsequent updates are delivered automatically in-app via Sparkle — you can also trigger a check manually from **ttaccessible > Check for updates…**.

## Importing servers

If you already use TeamTalk on your Mac, you can import your saved servers:

1. Open TTAccessible
2. Go to **Server > Import TeamTalk Servers…**
3. Select your `TeamTalk5.ini` file (the app navigates to the right folder automatically)

## Architecture

Native **macOS AppKit app** with SwiftUI preference panes. The audio pipeline uses a custom AUHAL capture engine (explicit CoreAudio device binding for every input, including system default) bypassing the TeamTalk SDK's built-in audio capture (which causes crackling on macOS). Captured PCM is resampled to the channel codec rate before injection via `TT_InsertAudioBlock` through a virtual sound device.

Echo cancellation uses WebRTC AEC3 (from `webrtc-audio-processing` v2.0, WebRTC M131) with the actual speaker output captured via Core Audio taps as the reference signal — not just the decoded TeamTalk audio. This allows cancellation of VoiceOver, system sounds, and all other audio.
